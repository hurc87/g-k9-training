        We offer a puppy program to help you and your puppy get off to the best start. In the program, we offer advice on supplies you should get before your puppy comes home, to make sure you are well equipped to enable your puppy to settle into his or her new home from day 1. We will then help you build a good foundation through a mixture of crate training, puppy manners, engagement and early socialization - done the right way! The team are here to guide you each step of the way, with weekly homework and milestone check ins for you and your puppy. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="light white-text">
        Once you have built your foundations, we can then take you to the next steps such as teaching recall, loose lead walking and working around distractions. Itâ€™s never too early to set you and your puppy up for success, putting in the work now will make such a difference to both of your lives.

              <span class="white-text">George has come to our rescue to help us with our crazy Cockapoo and our Macedonian rescue puppy ( no-one knows what breed she is).
                What a lovely, friendly chap he is! From the very start he picked up on key problems â€¦ that being me and The Husband, probably more than the dog.  ðŸ¤ª 
                George was incredibly knowledgeable, didnâ€™t rush any of our learning and left us with some great homework to be getting on with.
                I especially feel so reassured that our crazy dog will have a much better, enriched life and that our rescue will do too. 
                Thanks George

                George was professional, polite and clearly extremely good at what he does. we will be going back to George in the future for a refresher/review of how we are doing.

          <p class="left-align light white-text">
            I have had a passion for dogs from a young age, my parents are champion show dog breeders, so I have been around dogs and the industry my entire life.  I have 3 dogs of my own; our eldest is a Mastiff called Duke, our rescue Frenchie Roxie and our recent member of the family, an adopted Belgian Malinois called Ed - who I will be taking on a journey of PSA (so keep watching for more on this).  
          </p>
          <p class="left-align light white-text">
            I have trained for the last half a decade in dog psychology and undertaken the Fenrir training programme, and am still currently part of their network. It was this that led me from working in an industry I had been in since leaving school, to now be running my own dog training business. 
          </p>
          <p class="left-align light white-text">
            I love what I do and if I can help make a difference in you and your dog's life, then I will.
